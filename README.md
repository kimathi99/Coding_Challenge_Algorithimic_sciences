# Coding_Challenge_Algorithimic
This project involves the development of a server script that binds to a port and responds to connections, allowing for an unlimited number of concurrent connections. The server script receives a "String" as a connection in clear text. The path to find the file is specified in a configuration file, which may contain other irrelevant elements.
