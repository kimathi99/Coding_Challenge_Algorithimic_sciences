This is a server application that listens for client connections and performs search operations based on the received data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher installed
- Docker (optional)
- NGINX (for running the server in live environments)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/server-app.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

    shell
    cd server-app

    (Optional) If you prefer to use Docker, build the Docker image:

    shell
    docker build -t server-app .

Configuration

    Create a configuration file named .env in the project directory with the following contents:

    env
    REREAD_ON_QUERY=True
    linuxpath="path/to/config/file.txt"
    max_payload_size=1024

    Adjust the values of linuxpath and max_payload_size according to your requirements. The REREAD_ON_QUERY variable determines whether the server will read the configuration file on each query.

    Place your configuration file at the specified path (linuxpath) in the .env file.

Usage

    Without Docker:
    Remember to create a virtual environment  
    python install -r requirement.txt

    shell
    python server.py


    With Docker (assuming you built the Docker image):

    shell
    docker run -p 44445:44445 --env-file .env server-app

    Make sure to adjust the port number (44445) if necessary.

    For running the server in live environments using NGINX:

        Install NGINX on your server machine if not already installed.

        Configure NGINX to serve the server application:

            Copy the NGINX configuration file provided in the repository (nginx.conf) to the appropriate location on your server machine.

            Update the NGINX configuration file (nginx.conf) with the necessary server block and proxy settings.

            Adjust the server block settings according to your environment, such as the server name, IP address, SSL certificate paths, and ports.

        Start NGINX to serve the server application:

        shell
        nginx -c /path/to/nginx.conf

        Clients can connect to the server using the IP address of the server machine and the specified NGINX port.

Please adjust the instructions based on your specific NGINX configuration, such as the server block settings, SSL certificate paths, and port numbers.

Remember to provide the necessary NGINX configuration file (`nginx.conf`) with the appropriate settings based on your environment.
